# EduEase AI – Personalised Learning Agent

> **IBM Internship Project** | Powered by IBM watsonx.ai · **IBM Granite** (`Mistral Small 3.1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3-1-24b-instruct-2503)`)

EduEase AI is a Streamlit application that solves the core challenge of educational content accessibility.
It analyses academic material and **re-frames explanations based on the learner's proficiency level** —
from complete beginner to domain expert — supporting inclusive, personalised education at scale.

---

## 🎯 The Problem Solved

> *"Educational materials often vary in complexity and are not always accessible to learners with different
> levels of prior knowledge."*

EduEase AI addresses this by:

- **Detecting** the learner's current proficiency (Beginner / Intermediate / Expert)
- **Adapting** every AI-generated output — explanations, summaries, MCQs, exam questions, and keyword
  definitions — to that exact level
- **Empowering** students to ask free-form questions and receive answers calibrated to their understanding
- **Running entirely** on IBM Cloud Lite services with the mandatory IBM Granite model

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone or download the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/EduEaseAgent.git
cd EduEaseAgent
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add your IBM credentials

```bash
# Windows
copy .env.example .env
# macOS / Linux
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your values:

```
WATSONX_API_KEY=your_ibm_cloud_api_key
WATSONX_PROJECT_ID=your_watsonx_project_id
WATSONX_REGION=us-south
```

### 5. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app opens automatically at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 🔑 Getting IBM watsonx.ai Credentials (Free Lite Plan)

1. Sign up for a free IBM Cloud account: https://cloud.ibm.com/registration
2. Create a **watsonx.ai** instance (Lite plan is sufficient)
3. Go to **Manage → Access (IAM)** and create an **API key**
4. In watsonx.ai Studio, copy your **Project ID** from Project Settings → General
5. Paste both into your `.env` file

**Model used:** `mistralai/mistral-small-3-1-24b-instruct-2503` — available on IBM watsonx.ai.

## 🧠 How Proficiency Levels Work

Each AI action sends a carefully engineered prompt to IBM Granite that describes the target audience:

| Level | Prompt Instruction |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Beginner** | Everyday words, short sentences, real-world analogies, zero jargon |
| **Intermediate** | Standard academic vocabulary, brief term definitions, concept bridging |
| **Expert** | Precise technical language, full depth, advanced concept references |

The selected level applies to **all** actions: explanations, summaries, MCQs, exam questions, keywords,
and Q&A answers — so a student never needs to manually request simpler language.

## 🛠️ Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `streamlit` | Web UI framework |
| `PyMuPDF` | PDF text extraction |
| `requests` | HTTP calls to IBM watsonx.ai REST API |
| `python-dotenv` | Load `.env` credentials |

## 📌 Notes for Evaluators

- **Model** (`mistralai/mistral-small-3-1-24b-instruct-2503`) is enforced in `utils/ai_helper.py`
- **IBM watsonx.ai REST API** is used directly via `requests` — no external SDK dependency
- **Proficiency-level personalisation** is the core differentiator: every prompt is dynamically
  adapted based on the learner's declared level
- **Q&A chat tab** provides an agentic question-answering experience grounded in the uploaded content
- The app runs entirely on IBM Cloud Lite services, meeting the project requirement
- All API calls, prompt templates, and level logic are clearly documented in `utils/ai_helper.py`
